# FYP_Project
By the emergence of modern technologies in the
field of medicine, significant volumes of cancer data have been accumulated and easily
accessible for research purpose to the scientific community. A large volume of tumor
tissues has been sequenced and managed by The Cancer Genome Atlas in attempt to
comprehend the causes of human cancer. This huge amount expression data is available
publicly, which needs to be processed quickly and extract the information that further
contribute towards the effective and precise diagnostic decisions. Multiple machine
learning techniques have driven to make the progress in early cancer diagnoses and
prognosis based on gene expression profiles.
A research study had taken 24-primary tumor along adjacent tissue normal samples,
reprocessed the data and submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus repository. This
particular dataset was retrieved, and a comparative analysis has been conducted among
different machine learning and neural network-based algorithms in this project.
Multiclass cancer classification over 24 tumor types as well as binary classification task
over 17-types for which adjacent tissue normal samples were available has been
performed. Based on different evaluation matrixes, SVM linear kernel, MLP, XGBoost
and Logistic Regression performance were consistent in binary classification task
whilst in case of multiclass classification. SVM linear kernel classifier amongst which
achieved the best accuracy, F1, Recall and Precision scores. Most of the studies
conducted previously were cancer type specific and also not employed an ensemble of
machine learning algorithms as in this project. These comparative investigations among
different classifiers for cancer dataset would be helpful for community in model
selection as well as take this study as reference in their research.
